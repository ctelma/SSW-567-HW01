1. What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any?
I found this assignment challenging because I had to firstly brush up on my Python skills.
Additionally, I had a hard time figuring out if I should be using UnitTest or PyTest as I have never used either.
Once I had a better idea of what I was doing everything generally went pretty smoothly.

2. What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?
I thought the requirements specification of this assignment were kind of vague. For example, I was not sure what data type (int, string?) my inputs should be.
Also I had to create a section called "Not a triangle" to catch inputs that definitely do not create a triangle.
All in all, in the future I think it would be helpful if the instructions were a little more clear and not left up to the student's interpretation.

3. What challenges did you encounter with the tools?
Since I haven't worked much with UnitTest I had to understand how to use the tool and how to get it to work with my existing code.
Additionally there were many UnitTest Assert Methods, however, I only really used 2 as that made the most sense to me.

4. Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?
My strategy for testing this program was making sure each if/else statements were working properly as that was most of the logic in the code.
I looked up common triangle combinations online, and I ran them to ensure the expected answer was returned.
For isosceles and obtuse triangles, I checked them with and without right triangle properties.
Since equilateral triangles cannot be right, I did not test the two classifications together.
Since going in I knew there was a bug in the isosceles if/else statement, the testIsosceles function failed.
The rest of the tests passed as I predicted.
